{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:mibeta} provides descriptive statistics of standardized coefficients and
R-squared measures over imputed data when multiple-imputation analysis is
performed using linear regression: {cmd:mi estimate:} {cmd:regress}.


{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt fisherz} specifies that Rubin's rules are applied to the estimates of
standardized coefficients and R-squared measures after Fisher's z (inverse
hyperbolic tangent, {cmd:atanh()}) transformation.  The final estimates are
then transformed back using the inverse, hyperbolic tangent {cmd:tanh()},
transformation.  Using {cmd:fisherz} may lead to missing {cmd:mean} values
when the estimates of standardized coefficients are outside of [-1,1], which
may happen when regressors are highly collinear.

{phang}
{opt nocoef} suppresses the display of tables containing multiple-imputation
estimates of coefficients.  This option suppresses any output produced by
{cmd:mi estimate:} {cmd:regress}.

{phang}
{opt miopts(miopts)} controls multiple-imputation estimation.  {it:miopts}
specifies any options supported by {manhelp mi_estimate MI: mi estimate}.

{phang}
{it:regopts}; see {helpb regress##options:[R] regress}.


{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
By default, {cmd:mibeta} reports descriptive statistics (mean, median,
minimum, maximum, and the 25th and the 75th percentiles) of standardized
coefficients, R-squared and adjusted R-squared coefficients using the original
scale.  The reported {cmd:mean} statistic obtained by averaging the estimates
of these measures over imputed data (that is, by applying Rubin's rules to the
estimates in the original metric) must be used with caution because the
distribution of these measures is not symmetric and may be far from Normal.
Harel (2009) suggests to use Fisher's z transformation for the R-squared
measures to improve normality (option {cmd:fihserz}).  Marshall et al. (2009)
recommend to look at quantiles (as also reported by {cmd:mibeta}) of the
distribution over the imputed datasets to obtain more appropriate estimates.

{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:mibeta} is a wrapper for {cmd:mi estimate:} {cmd:regress} which also
computes summary statistics over imputed datasets for standardized
coefficients and R-squared measures.  {cmd:mibeta} is implemented as an ado
file.  The results stored by {cmd:mi estimate:} {cmd:regress} are stored in
{cmd:e()}.  In addition, {cmd:mibeta} stores mean estimates of standardized
coefficients in {cmd:e(b_std_mi)}, of R-squared in {cmd:e(r2_mi)}, and of
adjusted R-squared in {cmd:e(r2_adj_mi)}.  Other summary statistics such as
minimum, maximum, and quantiles for standardized coefficients and R-squared
measures computed over imputed datasets are stored in respective matrices
{cmd:e(b_std_stats_mi)}, {cmd:e(r2_stats_mi)}, and {cmd:e(r2_adj_stats_mi)}.
